# Full-Stack Assignment

## Unified Org Workspace

### (Ticketing + PR/Audit Console, JWT-Linked Identity)

_Froncort.AI — Full-Stack Intern Process, Round 2_

---

## Objective

Build a unified organization workspace comprising two dashboards — a **Support Hub (ticketing)** and a **Review & Audit Console (PR workflow)** — that share a single identity layer and feel like one coherent product to the end user.

The assignment is designed to assess:

- Your ability to design and implement a **secure, multi-tenant full-stack system** with **shared authentication** across applications.
- Your skill in enforcing **tenant isolation**, **cross-org access controls**, and **append-only audit logging**.
- Your product intuition for **session management**, **role-based access**, and real-world security constraints (**BOLA**, token revocation, password handling).

Frontend must be **Next.js or React.js**. Backend and database are your choice, kept focused on supporting the identity, isolation, and audit requirements described below.

---

## Core Functional Requirements

### 1. Shared Identity & Authentication Layer

- Email and password **authentication**.
- A central Identity/Org service acts as the **single source of truth** for users and organizations. Both dashboards read from this service; neither dashboard owns this data independently.
- **Session sync mechanism** — Both dashboards live under one parent domain.
- **Org switcher:** A user belonging to multiple organizations must be able to switch active org context.
- **Logout-everywhere:** Log out from both dashboards.

### 2. Dashboard 1 — Support Hub

- Ticket **CRUD operations**, comments, attachments, and status management.
- Tenant isolation enforced at the query layer — the **BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization)** test is non-negotiable.
- **Append-only audit log** recorded for every mutation.
- Per-tenant feature flags.
- A ticket can be shared with users from another organization. Shared users can view and participate in that ticket only — they cannot access any other tickets or data from the sharing organization.
- **Reviewer access:** Users with the Reviewer / Approver role must be able to access and review tickets in the Support Hub, in addition to their PR review responsibilities in Dashboard 2.

### 3. Dashboard 2 — Review & Audit Console

- **PR entity** comprising title, description, status (draft → in-review → approved/rejected → merged), linked organization, author, and a list of reviewers.
- Approval workflow supporting multiple reviewers, a configurable "**requires N approvals**" rule, and the ability for reviewers to request changes.
- **Versioning:** Every edit made after review has started creates a new version, with a diff view against the previous version.
- **Unified audit viewer:** A searchable, filterable timeline spanning both dashboards — filterable by organization, user, date range, and action type, and exportable as CSV.
- **Reviewer access:** Users with the Reviewer / Approver role must have access to both the PR review workflow and the unified audit trail viewer.

### 4. Cross-Org Collaboration

- Organizations can **connect** with partner organizations. A connection must be requested, approved, and revocable by either side.
- Once connected, either organization may **share individual tickets or PRs** with the partner — one item at a time, never full access to the other organization's workspace.
- External users from a partner organization can only see what has been explicitly shared with them.
- External users have **restricted access**: they can view and comment only — no editing, deleting, or accessing unshared content.

### 5. AI Progress Tracker

- Each user receives a **personalized digest scoped** to them (e.g. "You have 4 tickets assigned to you, 1 overdue" or "2 PRs are waiting on your review; oldest is 3 days idle").
- Digests are **delivered** on a **schedule via a background job** at regular, configurable intervals (e.g. every morning, or every N hours), not computed on page load.
- In-app notification bell at minimum.
- A user's digest may only include data from their own organization plus anything explicitly shared with them.

### 6. Access Control & Security

The system recognizes the following roles, each with a distinct scope of access:

| Role                     | Scope                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Org Admin**            | Full control within their own organization, across both dashboards.                                                                                                               |
| **Support Agent**        | Dashboard 1 only; manages tickets for their organization.                                                                                                                         |
| **Reviewer / Approver**  | Access to both dashboards: reviews and approves pull requests in Dashboard 2, reviews tickets in the Support Hub (Dashboard 1), and has access to the unified audit trail viewer. |
| **Cross-Org Guest**      | Limited, explicitly granted access to specific shared tickets or PRs from a partner organization — no access to anything else within that organization.                           |
| **Platform Super Admin** | Manages organizations, cross-org connections, and global platform settings.                                                                                                       |

Additional security requirements:

- Every query enforces organization scoping at the **query layer**, verified by **automated tests**, extended to cover the cross-org share path.
- A single, unified, append-only audit trail covers both dashboards.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** organization-level roles layered with app-specific roles.
- All cross-org sharing actions are audit-logged.

---

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Isolation** must hold even under **direct API calls** with manipulated IDs. An automated test covering this scenario is required.
- AI summaries must never leak cross-org data. A dedicated test covering this scenario is required.
- The audit log must be **appended only**, enforced at the database permission level.
- Both dashboards must be independently deployable.

---

## Extended (Optional) Scope

To showcase creative full-stack problem-solving, you may extend with:

- **GitHub integration** to mirror the status of a real PR via webhook.
- **Email/push delivery** for AI digests and notifications.
- Advanced audit analytics or anomaly detection.
- Custom org **onboarding flows** or admin console.

Use your design judgment to make the interface feel fluid, modern, and intuitive.

---

## Technology Expectations

### Architecture

- Well-structured module boundaries: Identity, Tickets, PRs, and Audit.
- Separation of auth logic, business logic, and data access layers.
- Shared component library across both dashboards.
- Automated tests for isolation, session sync, and token revocation.

### Suggested Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js + React + Tailwind CSS, with a shared component library across both dashboards.
- **Backend:** Node.js / Express.js.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Prisma.
- **Cache / Session:** Redis.
- **AI:** Any LLM API.

---

## Deliverables

- **Source Code Repository (GitHub link)**
  - Include basic seed data or a mock backend if required — at minimum, one sample org, one accepted cross-org connection, and a handful of sample tickets/PRs to demonstrate isolation and sharing behavior out of the box.
- **Hosted Project Public URL**
  - Provide a public URL where both dashboards (Support Hub and Review & Audit Console) can be accessed and evaluated, including test credentials for at least two organizations.
- **Documentation Folder (`/docs`)**
  - System architecture diagram (Identity/Org service, Dashboard 1, Dashboard 2).
  - Setup guide (local run).
  - Known limitations and future improvements.
- **Short Demo Video (~2 min)**

**PS:** You may add the agentic IDE/LLM used (if any) for coding, with reasoning, pros and cons, in the documentation.
